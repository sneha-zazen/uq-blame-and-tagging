This file is a blame file.


I'm writing multiple lines and you should be able to see who they're written by.

git blame is a command that displays information regarding the authership and commit details for each individual line in a file.

I'm adding in a few more lines down here, because I need to add a new feature.
git blame -L 3,5 blame_file.txt
